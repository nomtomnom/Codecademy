This is a repository I am using to practice Github while also documenting projects made through Codecademy's webdev track. 

As I am a beginner, I am certain a lot of it is very messy. 

If you are digging through and see any really awful stuff let me know, but if I am doing this correctly I have already figured out my mistakes!
